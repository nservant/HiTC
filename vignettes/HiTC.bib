  abstract = {We developed a general approach that combines chromosome conformation
	capture carbon copy (5C) with the Integrated Modeling Platform (IMP)
	to generate high-resolution three-dimensional models of chromatin
	at the megabase scale. We applied this approach to the ENm008 domain
	on human chromosome 16, containing the alpha-globin locus, which is expressed
	in K562 cells and silenced in lymphoblastoid cells (GM12878). The
	models accurately reproduce the known looping interactions between
	the α-globin genes and their distal regulatory elements. Further,
	we find using our approach that the domain folds into a single globular
	conformation in GM12878 cells, whereas two globules are formed in
	K562 cells. The central cores of these globules are enriched for
	transcribed genes, whereas nontranscribed chromatin is more peripheral.
	We propose that globule formation represents a higher-order folding
	state related to clustering of transcribed genes around shared transcription
	machineries, as previously observed by microscopy.},

  journal = {Nature},
  year = {2012},
  month = {Apr},
  abstract = {The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its
	biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic
	structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of
	eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome
	territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes
	fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide
	only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher
	order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in
	genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional
	genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a
	method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome
	wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the
	human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated
	cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized
	local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains',
	as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These
	domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread
	of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell
	types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological
	domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we
	find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for
	the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer
	RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating
	that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological
	domain structure of the genome.},

	5C to analyze a 400-kb region containing the human beta-globin locus

	of several previously identified looping interactions in the beta-globin
	locus. We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells
	between the beta-globin Locus Control Region and the gamma-beta-globin
	intergenic region. Interestingly, this region has been implicated
	in the control of developmental globin gene switching. 5C should
	be widely applicable for large-scale mapping of cis- and trans- interaction

  month = {Apr},
  abstract = {In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range
	elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example
	of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates
	the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling
	the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent
	of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains
	unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy
	(5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization
	of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series
	of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains
	(TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on
	the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several
	domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2
	blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately
	regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic
	chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation.
	The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the
	spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods,
	with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent
	TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify
	a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces
	a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle
	of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study
	sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation

	Previous evidence has suggested that long-range chromatin interactions
	may contribute to the regulation of PcG target genes. Here, we adapted
	the Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) assay to systematically
	map chromosomal interactions in Drosophila melanogaster larval brain
	tissue. Our results demonstrate that PcG target genes interact extensively
	with each other in nuclear space. These interactions are highly specific
	for PcG target genes, because non-target genes with either low or
	high expression show distinct interactions. Notably, interactions
	are mostly limited to genes on the same chromosome arm, and we demonstrate
	that a topological rather than a sequence-based mechanism is responsible
	for this constraint. Our results demonstrate that many interactions
	among PcG target genes exist and that these interactions are guided
	by overall chromosome architecture.},

  abstract = {Hi-C experiments measure the probability of physical proximity between

	GC content of trimmed ligation junctions and sequence uniqueness.
	To address these biases, we introduce an integrated probabilistic
	background model and develop algorithms to estimate its parameters
	and renormalize Hi-C data. Analysis of corrected human lymphoblast
	contact maps provides genome-wide evidence for interchromosomal aggregation
	of active chromatin marks, including DNase-hypersensitive sites and
	transcriptionally active foci. We observe extensive long-range (up
	to 400 kb) cis interactions at active promoters and derive asymmetric
	contact profiles next to transcription start sites and CTCF binding
	sites. Clusters of interacting chromosomal domains suggest physical
	separation of centromere-proximal and centromere-distal regions.
	These results provide a computational basis for the inference of

	were highly enriched in cis along single chromosomes containing target
	DSBs and within other chromosomes and subchromosomal domains in a

	a strategy termed circular chromosome conformation capture (4C).
	This approach involves a circularization step that enables high-throughput
	screening of physical interactions between chromosomes without a
	preconceived idea of the interacting partners. Here we identify 114
	unique sequences from all autosomes, several of which interact primarily
	with the maternally inherited H19 imprinting control region. Imprinted
	domains were strongly overrepresented in the library of 4C sequences,
	further highlighting the epigenetic nature of these interactions.
	Moreover, we found that the direct interaction between differentially
	methylated regions was linked to epigenetic regulation of transcription
	in trans. Finally, the patterns of interactions specific to the maternal
	H19 imprinting control region underwent reprogramming during in vitro
	maturation of embryonic stem cells. These observations shed new light
	on development, cancer epigenetics and the evolution of imprinting.},
