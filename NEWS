   o Bug in import.my5C function


***********************************
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.5

NEW FEATURES

   o The normLGF function can now be applied both on intra and inter-chromosomal maps

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o Access the contact map is now ALWAYS performed using chromosomes' name such as ygi/xgi, i.e. rownames/colnames of contact maps

***********************************
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.4

NEW FEATURES

   o ICE normalization can now be applied on both HTCexp and HTClist objects

   o New methods for HTClist-class : isComplete, isPairwise, forcePairwise, forceSymmetric

   o New methods for HTCexp-class : forceSymmetric

   o New methods (not exported) for HTClist-class : getCombinedIntervals, getCombinedContacts

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o Update of the binningC method. Improvement of speed and memory usage. The binningC function can now be applied on Hi-C data (or any already binned data). The goal is to move from a very high resolution map (for instance 40kb) to a lower resolution ( for instance 1Mb) by aggregationg and summing the bins.

   o Update of the importC/exportC functions which are now based on a new format (list with interactor1/interactor2/count + BED files). This format is recommanded to store sparse data because only the non null values are exported/imported.

   o Update of the import.my5C/export.m5C functions. Only the matrix format is now supported. For the list format, see the importC/exportC functions.

BUG FIXES

   o Bug fixed in divide method

***********************************
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.3

NEW FEATURES
   
   o Add new normalization method for Hi-C data from Hu et al (HiCNorm). This method is based on linear regression model between interaction counts and sources of bias such as GC content, mappability, fragment length, etc. See normLGF(), setGenomicFeatures(), getAnnotatedRestrictionSites().

   o Add new normalization method for Hi-C data from Imakaev et al.(ICE). The ICE procedure is an iterative normalization method used to remove any bias from HiC data.

   o Add 'summary' method for HTCexp and HTClist objects

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o Improve quality control methods based using sparse data

   o Change method option for normPerTrans methods. The 'mean' method is in fact a 'max' method

   o Update of the export.my5C list format

BUG FIXES

   o max (na.rm=TRUE) in mapC function

***********************************
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.2

NEW FEATURES

    o Efficient memory matrix representation using the Matrix package. The memory usage for big sparse matrix is improved by a factor 7. However, some operation are much slower based on the Matrix implementation. Thus, for some task as the plotting function, the Matrix are converted in standard matrix based object

    o 'show' and 'detail' method for HTClist object

    o 'c(x, ...)' method for HTCexp and HTClist objects

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The option mask.data from the mapC function is deprecated

    o Update of parallel computation for some functions (import, normalize)

BUG FIXES

***********************************
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1

NEW FEATURES

   o MAJOR RELEASE : replace all GenomeIntervals objects by GRanges ones in order to improve the compatibility with other HT BioC packages

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
 
   o The ExtractRegion method has a new MARGIN parameter. The idea is the same than for any apply function. If MARGIN is equal to 1 (resp. 2, resp. c(1,2)), the region is extracted from the 'x' (resp. 'y', resp. both) intervals 
   
   o Plot function. When two HTCexp objects are plot together, only the intersection of the 'x' and 'y' intervals are used.

   o The 'range' method now returns a GRanges object

   o Changes in the data windowing for the extreme bins

   o mapC requires a HTCexp object only. Objects from the matrix class are no longer allowed
